            <p>Every journey has a beginning, and this starts my journey towards sharing my opinions, learnings, and becoming a better version of myself. I have been planning to create a blog (well, actually I call it knowledge log -- <em>klog</em>) for the past two years already, to keep track of what I've learned (and somehow brag about it :) ). Of course, this blog also serves as the gateway for showing my portfolio. I'm not the best writer nor I claim to be a good communicator, but by writing everyday (or every week) I'm challenging myself to become better.</p>
<p>I will write about my discoveries related to programming languages like <em>Python</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, and <em>Swift</em>. I also plan to write about any projects that I've started. I really like reading clean codes and learning from them, so I will also post things related on how an open source project works. Specifically, the problems that the project is trying to solve and how it was solved. Lastly, I will also share CS related papers that I've read and analyzed. I intend to specialize in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</p>
<p>I'm 26 years old, with ~6 years of experience (as of Nov 2016) in providing solutions to everyday problems through software programming. I intend to improve myself both in technical and non-technical aspect. In line with this, I really hope the future me would be grateful that I took the step in creating and maintaining this blog.</p>
<p>If you have suggestions, comments or even corrections (in grammar or content related), kindly email me at <em>markronquillo23@gmail.com</em>. Hope to get in touch with you, my dear reader. Cheers!</p>
