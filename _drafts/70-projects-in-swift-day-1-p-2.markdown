We continue to discuss the Day 1's projects, which are __Custom Settings__ and __Tip Calculator__. The __Custom Settings__ uses a custom settings page for the application to use. We are given an option to toggle the __Night Mode__ setting that sets the application to night mode. The app is composed of _TextView_ that occupies the whole app page, except the status bar area.
