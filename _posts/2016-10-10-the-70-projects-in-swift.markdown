Reinventing a project is one way to learn how a specific thing works. Trying to solve a problem yourself forces you to think, digest information and properties the problem has. Coming up with a simple solution, and improving it incrementally, is one way to progressively solve the problem.

<!-- ios Development -->
Last 2014, Apple introduced its new programming language __Swift__. Mastering a programming language is never an easy task. This can only be achieved through sheer hardwork and repeated use of the programming language. On top of that, iOS development also shares its own challenges. Using Xcode and mastering the frameworks Apple provides, require sufficient time investment.

<!-- Previous challenges -->
Recently, developers challenged themselves to create a series of minimal projects to develop their skills in a specific language or tool. Sam Vlu _http://samvlu.com/_ created _40_ iOS projects in 100 days. Allen Wong _https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift_ created _30_ iOS projects in a span of 30 days. 

<!-- The Challenge -->
Now, I am challenging myself to reproduce these projects within 30 days. Everyday, I will be posting what I've learned in every project that I have finished. Approximately, 3 projects a day is needed to complete the 70 projects. All projects are stored in this repository _https://github.com/markronquillo/70ProjectsInSwift_.
